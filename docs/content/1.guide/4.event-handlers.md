# Event handlers

In order to keep the Opentelemetry context within your event handlers, you need to wrap your own with `defineTracedHandler` from `nitro-opentelemetry/runtime/utils`:

```ts
// this is also auto-imported
import { defineTracedEventHandler } from "nitro-opentelemetry/runtime/utils"

export default defineTracedEventHandler(() => {
    return "Hello World !"
})
```
