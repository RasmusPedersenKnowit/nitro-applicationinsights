# How does it works ?

`nitro-applicationinsights` is simply a package which provides a plugin for nitro.

It setup the default client of `applicationinsights` on nitro start up. You can configure this by hooking into the `applicationinsights:config` hook of nitro.

Then on each request, it instantiate a new `TelemetryClient` attached to the event. There's also a continuity in the `traceId`.

And after each response, the request is tracked with `trackRequest()`.
