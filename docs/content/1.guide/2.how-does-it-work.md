# How does it works ?

`nitro-applicationinsights` is simply a package which provides a plugin for nitro.

It setup the default client of `applicationinsights` on nitro start up. You can configure this by hooking into the `applicationinsights:config` hook of nitro.

Since `applicationinsights` v3 uses Opentelemetry under the hood, this nitro plugin also run `nitro-opentelemetry`.

# Automated traces

The `nitro-opentelemetry` plugin will automatically trace all your incoming and outgoing request from your Nitro server.
This means that you don't need to call `defaultClient.trackDependency()` yourself.
